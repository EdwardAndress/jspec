# Welcome to JSpec â€“ a home made javascript testing framework

### Why make my own testing frame work?

To learn!

### If you really want to use it

The syntax is very similar to that of Jasmine.

The following functions should feel familiar and behave predictably.
- `describe(functionName, callback)`
- `it(expectedReturnValue, callback)`
- `expect(functionCall)`
- `Expectation#toEqual(expectedValue)`

More matchers are on the way!
